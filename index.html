          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Hi there! I'm <strong>Joy Muriithi</strong>, a recent graduate with
            a Bachelor's degree in Real Estate Management from Mount Kenya
            University. My journey through real estate has taught me how spaces
            impact people's lives, but my curiosity didn’t stop there. I’ve
            always been fascinated by technology, which led me to explore new
            avenues, including a short course on
            <strong>AI Career Essentials</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            What drives me? I’m passionate about solving real-world problems,
            whether it’s in property management or through the limitless
            potential of AI and tech. I’m a lifelong learner, always eager to
            discover how emerging technologies can shape industries and improve
            people's lives.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I’m not diving into tech or real estate, you’ll find me
            thinking about my next big project—something innovative, something
            impactful. Let’s build something amazing together!

          <h2>Interests & What Excites Me in Tech</h2>
          <p>
            I’m fascinated by the world of <strong>web development</strong>,
            from crafting the perfect front-end user experience to the intricate
            logic of back-end systems. Web development allows me to blend
            creativity and functionality in ways that solve real-world problems.
            My journey into <strong>AI</strong> has also sparked a deep interest
            in how intelligent systems can enhance everything from automation to
            data-driven decision-making.
          </p>
          <p>
            What excites me the most about technology? It's the limitless
            potential for innovation. Technology is constantly evolving,
            offering new tools to solve problems and shape the future. The idea
            that something we create today could transform industries tomorrow
            keeps me motivated and curious. There’s always something new to
            learn, and that’s what drives me forward.

            <h3>Teachable Machine in AI</h3>
            <p>
              I worked on a project using <strong>Teachable Machine</strong>, an
              easy-to-use tool that allows users to create machine learning
              models without needing extensive coding skills. This project
              involved training a model to recognize specific patterns and
              behaviors, showcasing the power of AI in understanding and
              interpreting data.

            <h3>Creating a Song Using Udio</h3>
            <p>
              This project focused on <strong>Udio</strong>, a platform for
              music creation. I explored how to compose and produce a song,
              learning the intricacies of digital audio workstations and music
              production techniques. This hands-on experience enhanced my
              understanding of audio technology and creativity.
